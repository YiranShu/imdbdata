So with time going by, the movie genre have changed a lot. Are there any relationships between movie genres and the ratings, or between the directors and movie genres? Our goal is to explore some interesting facts about different movie genres. We will find out these questions: 1.1 What was the relationship between genres and ratings? For example, what genres were more likely to gain higher ratings? We will use title.ratings.tsv.gz and title.basics.tsv.gz on https://datasets.imdbws.com/. There are features tconst, averageRating and numVotes in title.ratings.tsv.gz. The feature tconst identifies the title of each movie and links the genres feature in title.basics.tsv.gz. With these features, we can visualize the relationship between genres and ratings. 1.2 What are the most common words in movie titles of different genres? We will use title.basics.tsv.gz to explore the most commonly used words in movie titles of different genres. In addition, we will explore how the lengths of movie titles of different genres have changed over time. 1.3 For each director, did he/she have a preference in any genres? We can first group movies by directors using title.crew.tsv.gz and title.basics.tsv.gz. For each director, we will explore his/her movies and genres so we could conclude if the director preferred certain genres. 1.4 How have the genres of movies been changing since last century? We will use title.basics.tsv.gz on https://datasets.imdbws.com/. It has not only tconst, which identifies the title of each movie, but also startYear and genres features so we visualized the change of popularity of dramas, documentaries, comedies, thrillers, action movies and romantic movies since 1915 in the interactive component.

The frequencies of action movies, romantic movies, thrillers, crime movies, horror movies and adventure movies are close and more than the frequencies of other genres. In the interactive component section, we will mainly analyze some interesting facts about the most frequent genres. 3.4 Save the transformed dataframes Finally, we want to save the transformed dataframes so that we can load them anytime we want without perfroming the transformation again. save(title.genres, file=&#39;data/title.genres.RData&#39;) save(title.basics, file=&#39;data/title.basics.RData&#39;) save(name.basics, file=&#39;data/name.basics.RData&#39;) save(title.crew, file=&#39;data/title.crew.RData&#39;) save(title.principals, file=&#39;data/title.principals.RData&#39;) save(title.ratings, file=&#39;data/title.ratings.RData&#39;) "],["missing-values-1.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 title.bacis", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 title.bacis 4.1.1 Missing values by column colSums(is.na(title.basics)) %&gt;% sort(decreasing = TRUE) ## endYear runtimeMinutes startYear genres tconst titleType primaryTitle originalTitle isAdult ## 594338 220659 76086 71319 0 0 0 0 0 4.1.2 Missing patterns source(&quot;scripts/visna.R&quot;) visna(title.basics) visna(title.basics, percent=TRUE) From the graph, we can see that there are no missing values in columns nconst and primaryName. Most missing values are in columns deathYear and birthYear. This might be due to the difficulty of getting the specific birth and death time and the fact that some people are not dead. Only a minority of missing values are in columns primaryProfession and knownForTitles. Furthermore, deathYear and birthYear are both missing in most rows with missing data. It might be due to the high correlation between these 2 columns. Only a very small proportion of rows have no missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Movie ratings 5.2 Most popular directors 5.3 Movie titles", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Movie ratings 5.1.1 Ratings for all movies IMDB rating is a good reference if we want to know the quality of different movies. Do different genres have obviously different average ratings? Has the quality of movies changed over time? We can find something from the figure below: This is an interesting plot about the ratings of different genres changing with time. The top one calculates the average ratings of movies from each genre and each year. It seems that Documentary, Biograph and Music have the highest ratings, while ratings for Horror movies are the lowest. And there is no obvious trend along the Year dimension. However, lets consider this situation: there are two Action movies in 2050.One gets 10000 votes of 10 star, one gets gets 1 vote of 0 star. The average rating would be 5 star. This seems a little unfair, right? So we also use weighted average, where weights are their number of votes, and we get the bottom plot. Surprisingly, the ratings between different genres are not so large as we thought. Documentary and Biography are not much higher than the others, although Horror still seems the lowest. Another interesting discovery is that there is a trend along time: movies before 2000 clearly have higher weighted ratings than movies after 2000. Maybe this is a reflection that the quality of movies in recent years are not as well as before? 5.1.2 Rating distributions for highly rated movies Now that we have a view of ratings of all movies, what about those top-rating movies? Do people have preference among different genres when they are rating? We select 100 top-rating movies of different genres and plot their distributions: If we select movies from all of them, we get the red distributions. But if we only consider movies with more than 5000 votes, we get the purple ones. We find that Documentary has the highest median if we consider all movies, but it gets lower if we exclude those without enough votes. It turns out that there are many documentary movies only have 20 or 50 votes with almost 10 star ratings. Its the same with biography and music movies. If we exclude these not well-known works, we can get a picture of the preferences of the most population. It shows that people tend to give higher ratings for Romance movies, while its very hard for Horro movies to get high scores. 5.1.3 Number of votes As we can see, those movies with few votes can cause big difference when we are analysing the data. What are these movies like? We select those movies with less than 5,000 votes on IMDB and see where they come from: These movies mostly come from Drama, Comedy, Documentary, which is not very surprising. However, we can sense that they may have different ratings, because when we exclude these movies, the average ratings of different genres change differently. So now we plot the ratings of these movies and get this: As we can see, among these movies, Documentary mostly have 6-10 stars, while Horror movies mostly have 0-6 stars. This proves what we think: there exists many documentary movies with small number of votes but very high ratings. 5.1.4 Dependency between votes, ratings and runtime Now we may wonder if votes and ratings have some relationship. The graph below shows the relationship among three variables: votes, ratings, and runtime. Note that we only select popular movies (with number of votes larger than 200,000) to exclude those noisy less popular movies. The average rating and number of votes have obvious relationship. This is not difficult to understand: better movies are usually more popular so more people would vote. We also find that longer movies tend to have higher ratings. This is an interesting discovery. One reason could be that longer movies usually come from those with meaningful topics, while entertainment movies are usually shorter. 5.1.5 Movies with most stars We have learned that average ratings and number of votes both reflect a movies quality. Now lets combine these two metrics together to find the best movies on IMDB. If we consider 10 score as 10 stars, we want to find the movies with most stars in history. We can consider them the most influential movies. The plot shows the rating and number of votes of the 20 movies with most stars on IMDB. You must have heard most of them, if you havent watched all of them. Top 1 is the famous The Shawshank Redemption, which is not very surprising. All the movies in top 20 are released after 1990, except The Godfather (1972). The second one and the third one are both directed by Christopher Nolan, one of the most popular directors nowadays. There are totally 5 of the top 20 movies directed by Nolan! Two of three The Lord of the Rings, directed by Peter Jackson, get into top 10. Other famous directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg and David Fincher, also have more than one movies in top 20. 5.2 Most popular directors 5.2.1 Top10 directors with most stars Lets use the same way to find the most popular directors! Here we find the top 10 directos and their rating distributions: I am sure you have heard most of them. Note than the width of boxes reflects the number of movies directed by that director. As we can see, Nolan has the highest median ratings, although his number of movies are not a lot. Steve Spielberg directed most movies among them, while James Cameron directed the least number. We can also notice that the directors with more movies have lower average ratings, which is understandable since its hard to make all of your works liked by most of the people. 5.2.2 Genre preference of top10 directors Which genres are prefered by these famous directors? We can find them in this plot: The top10 directos made 227 movies in total! It shows that Drama, Action and Adventure are the most. Martin Scorsese seems like Biography and Documentary compared with the others. Robert Zemeckis make the most number of Comedy, although his most famous work is Forrest Gump. Crime seems to be Quentins favorite. 5.3 Movie titles 5.3.1 Most common words in titles Do movies of different genres prefer different words in titles? For example, maybe there are a lot of heart in Romance movies titles? Here we select 15 most common words from Action, Animation, Romance, Sci_Fi (meaningless words like the, to are excluded): The genre of each plot is hidden. Can you match these four plots with the four genres? It should be easy. The first one, with love having highest frequency, is Romance. We can also see girl, heart, wedding in these titles. The second one have vs, blood, hero, so it is obviously Action. What about alien, space, star? Sci_Fi movies love these topics! And lastly, for little children, little, magic, christmas. It must be Animation. Do you get them all right? Also we can notice that love is one of the most common words for many genres. Maybe love is the eternal theme for human! 5.3.2 Length of Titles Whats the average length of movie titles and does it change with time? We plot the average length of titles: We can see that at first they dont have much difference, but as time develops Music and Documentary have longer titles with average length of 4, and Comedy, Action, Sci-Fi have shorter average titles. It can also be noticed that their average title length was decreasing from 1970 to 2000, but after 2000 their length has been increasing. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Click to play again! From the animation, it can be found that from 1915 to 2020, for most of years, the proportion of each genre has not changed much. The number of dramas has always been the largest among all genres though the proportion of dramas has decreased compared with the proportion 100 years ago. However, an interesting fact is that the proportion of documentaries has surged since 1990. In 1990, the proportion of documentaries ranked 4th or 5th. But in the 21st century, the proportion of documentaries ranked 2nd and got very close to the proportion of dramas. It seems that the number of documentaries will surpass the number of dramas in a few years. We guess the spike in the number of documentaries is due to rapid development of film technology in recent decades. As everyone knows, some documentaries are recreating the original appearance of history, which require the most advanced film technology compared with other genres (drama, comedy, thriller, action and romance). We searched the internet for reason for the spike in the number of documentaries since 1990. We found an article that also attributes the spike to the development of technology. The following 2 paragraphs are extracts from the original article (https://medium.com/@brianrowe_70270/the-growing-technology-in-documentary-filmmaking-78ae31d48ac3). Cut to the dawn of the new millennium, when a movie called The Blair Witch Project comes along to shake up the industry. When a movie like that, which cost just pennies in relation to the millions of dollars it made at the box office, comes along, people start to take notice, and other filmmakers begin to see that in order to be successful, one doesnt need fifty million dollars to make a movie. The last two decades have shown an explosion of documentary films, primarily because the technology now allows for anyone with a dream to go out and make a movie. All one literally needs is a camera, a computer, an editing program, and an idea. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion The goals of our project is to find out some interesting things in the field of Movies. Before doing the research we did not have any idea about the relationship between ratings and genres or the relationship genres and directors. However now we have basic ideas about Movies. Here are some conclusions we have found: Using average ratings and weighted ratings came out difference results. There is a trend along time: movies before 2000 clearly have higher weighted ratings than movies after 2000. Large number of movies with less than 5000 votes comes from Drama, Comedy and Documentary. There exists many documentary movies with small number of votes but very high ratings. The higher the rating is, the more the number of votes. Longer movies tend to have higher ratings. Love is one of the most common words for many genres. The director who made a lot of movies in one genre does not mean he has a high ratings in this genre. Each directors ratings of different genre are almost the same. The proportion of documentaries has surged since 1990 perhaps because of the rapid development of technology. And we still have some limitations. For example, based on conclusion 2, we did not really know the exact reason that caused the trend. So we may need some further research on the causes. Also since there are a lot of movies with less than 5000 votes and we did not analyze it specifically, it may have some other interesting conclusions we can find through it. Another important direction we want to figure out is the relationship between different genres and directors. Since the data here has more than 220000 directors, it is really hard to analyze all the directors in such a short time. Now we only analyzed one genre Action movies. So we can do further analyze based on different genres: finding out top 10 directors in each genre, any overlaps between each genres etc. Therefore, there are still many things we can do in the future to enhance our knowledge in movies.
