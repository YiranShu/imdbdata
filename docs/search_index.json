So with time going by, the movie genre have changed a lot. Are there any relationships between movie genres and the ratings, or between the directors and movie genres? Our goal is to explore some interesting facts about different movie genres. We will find out three main questions as follows: 1.1 How have the genres of movies been changing since last century? We will use title.basics.tsv.gz on https://datasets.imdbws.com/. It has not only tconst, which identifies the title of each movie, but also startYear and genres features so we can visualize the change of genre popularity since 1900. 1.2 What was the relationship between genres and ratings? For example, what genres were more likely to gain higher ratings? We will use title.ratings.tsv.gz and title.basics.tsv.gz on https://datasets.imdbws.com/. There are features tconst, averageRating and numVotes in title.ratings.tsv.gz. The feature tconst identifies the title of each movie and links the genres feature in title.basics.tsv.gz. With these features, we can visualize the relationship between genres and ratings. 1.3 For each director, did he/she have a preference in any genres? We can first group movies by directors using title.crew.tsv.gz and title.basics.tsv.gz. For each director, we will explore his/her movies and genres so we could conclude if the director preferred certain genres.

Most missing values are in columns deathYear and birthYear. This might be due to the difficulty of getting the specific birth and death time and the fact that some people are not dead. Only a minority of missing values are in columns primaryProfession and knownForTitles. Furthermore, deathYear and birthYear are both missing in most rows with missing data. It might be due to the high correlation between these 2 columns. Only a very small proportion of rows have no missing values.
