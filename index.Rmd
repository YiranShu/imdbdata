# Introduction

Our goal is to explore interesting facts about different movie genres.
We will find out three questions as follows:
(1). How have the genres of movies been changing since last century?
(2). What was the relationship between genres and ratings? For example, what genres were more likely to gain higher ratings?
(3). For each director, did he/she have a preference in any genres?
